obs-ios-camera-source Linux branch
==============
This is a fork of [obs-ios-camera-source](https://github.com/wtsnz/obs-ios-camera-source) that supports Linux.

To use this you use the [accompanying iOS app](https://obs.camera/) to begin streaming in OBS.

## Downloads

### Ubuntu 20.04 (and possibly other distros) and 18.04

Go to the [actions](https://github.com/dougg3/obs-ios-camera-source/actions) section of this repository and click on the latest workflow that finished successfully. Then download the artifact that corresponds to your version. After downloading, place the zip file in your home directory and run:

```
unzip plugin-ubuntu-*.zip
```

You must have the `unzip` package installed for this to work: `sudo apt install unzip`.

## Building

These instructions are tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04. For other distros/versions, YMMV.

- Make sure you have the universe and multiverse repositories enabled so you will have access to FFmpeg.
- Install OBS Studio using the [instructions on the OBS wiki](https://obsproject.com/wiki/install-instructions#ubuntu-installation).
- Install prerequisites: `sudo apt install build-essential git cmake libavcodec-dev libssl-dev`
  - Note: On Fedora, the required package for OpenSSL is called openssl-devel.
- Download the OBS Studio source code somewhere: 
  - `cd ~/Downloads`
  - `git clone https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio.git`
- Download this plugin source code:
  - `git clone https://github.com/dougg3/obs-ios-camera-source.git`
- Build the plugin:
  - `cd obs-ios-camera-source`
  - `mkdir build`
  - `cd build`
  - `cmake .. -DLIBOBS_INCLUDE_DIR=~/Downloads/obs-studio/cmake`
  - `make -j$(nproc)`
- Manually install the plugin by copying relevant files into your OBS plugins directory (assuming 64-bit Linux):
  - `mkdir -p ~/.config/obs-studio/plugins/obs-ios-camera-source/data/locale`
  - `mkdir -p ~/.config/obs-studio/plugins/obs-ios-camera-source/bin/64bit`
  - `cp ../data/locale/en-US.ini ~/.config/obs-studio/plugins/obs-ios-camera-source/data/locale/`
  - `cp obs-ios-camera-source.so ~/.config/obs-studio/plugins/obs-ios-camera-source/bin/64bit/`

## Special thanks
- [wtsnz](https://github.com/wtsnz) for creating an awesome plugin/app for using your iOS camera in OBS!
